# myCinema
Spring-boot project with a made up "cinema" website which currently has only a few endpoints to add and change some entities.

A few endpoints to try:
# appUser
https://localhost:4001/admin/appUser/addNew 

https://localhost:4001/admin/appUser/delete

# movie
https://localhost:4001/admin/movie/addNew

https://localhost:4001/admin/movie/update

Dockerfile is not configured yet so right now this only works locally.
